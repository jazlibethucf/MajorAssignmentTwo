    <h1>What is Bee and Puppycat About?</h1>
    <p>I'm so glad you asked! Bee and Puppycat is a show you might have come across on Netflix. It was recently released on Netflix but the story of this show has a longer history than you think! This animated series was on Cartoon Hangover, a television channel essentially, that was created by the goddess herself Natasha Allegri and produced by Frederator Studios. You might be familiar with this animation company because they produced popular Nickelodeon shows suchs as The Fairly OddParents and other shows like Adventure Time. Two shorts were released on Youtube in 2013 and Bee and Puppycat was born. The show became so popular that there was a comic book adaptation of the show for about 2 years. The support for the show was so overwhelming that the fans contributed to the Kickstarter campaign to make the show into a full series. As a result, 10 episodes were released on Youtube, which are considered Bee and Puppycat's first season and can be found on Youtube. 
        
    <h2>So what now?</h2>
    <p>Well, a second season of Bee and Puppycat was supposed to be created and released on another streaming platform but it was never released and leaked online. </p>
