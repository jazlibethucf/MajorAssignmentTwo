    <h1 class="heading"> What is Bee and Puppycat About?</h1>
    <p> Alright fine, here's the google result. "An unemployed woman named Bee lives a normal life until her grumpy companion PuppyCat arrives and the begin travelling between reality and "Fishbowl Space." But I promise the show is way more intriguing than that over simplified summary okay!</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Where did Bee and Puppycat Come From?</h2>
    <p><strong>I'm so glad you asked!</strong> Bee and Puppycat is a show you might have come across on Netflix. It was recently released on Netflix, but the story of this show has a longer history than you think! This animated series was on Cartoon Hangover, a television channel essentially, that was created by the goddess herself Natasha Allegri and produced by Frederator Studios. You might be familiar with this animation company because they produced popular shows such as The Fairly OddParents and Adventure Time. Two shorts were released on Youtube in 2013 and Bee and Puppycat was born. The show started to become popular which led to the creation of the comic book adaptation of the show for about 2 years. The support for the show was so overwhelming that the fans contributed to the Kickstarter campaign to make the show into a full series. As a result, 10 episodes were released on Youtube, which are still there today, and are considered Bee and Puppycat's first full season.
        
    <h2 class="subtitle">So what now?</h2>
    <p>Well, a second season of Bee and Puppycat: Lazy in Space was created and was supposed to be released on another streaming platform but becuase of delays it was never released and leaked online. I didn't find the online leak <strong>(wink wink)</strong>. The second season was just drifting until Netflix picked it up, re-adapted the pilot and the first season, which was terrible, and attatched the Lazy in Space original episodes. I can only hope Netlix does't destory my favorite show and that the fans are able to bully these big companies.</p>
